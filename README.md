# NiklasJordan/ama

A repository to ask [Niklas Jordan](https://twitter.com/niklas_jordan) anything.

I explore different ways to use technology for social and environmental good. I’m doing this professionally since 2008. Actually, I’m helping organisations to use Earth observation technology with environmental impact and human rights in mind. With [OpenSpaceData](https://www.openspacedata.org/) I’ve founded an organisation with the mission to democratizing satellite data – through easy to use tools and education. If you have a question you're interested in reading me tap out a response for, this is just the joint for you. I've just founded [DisasterTech](https://www.disaster-tech.org/), a global community of people who develop tools that help humans in crisis situations.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/NiklasJordan/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/NiklasJordan/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 280 characters
